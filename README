The Classic Snake game
----------------------

This version of snake was written with the Borland Turbo C++ 3.0 compiler.
As a result, you need to install Turbo C 3.0 to run the game.

Follow these instructions to run the game:

1) Install dosbox.
   Dosbox is an emulator for DOS, you can install it with:
   	  Linux: apt-get install dosbox
      	  FreeBSD: pkg install dosbox
	  Windows/Others: Get installer from https://www.dosbox.com/

2) Install Turbo C 3.0
   Create a directory called dosbox in some directory (result: $PATH/dosbox)
   Inside this new directory, create a directory called TCSETUP (result: $PATH/dosbox/TCSETUP)

   Unzip the tc3.zip (included in this repo) into the TCSETUP directory.

   Execute dosbox.

   Following commands at the DOS prompt:
   	     mount C: $PATH/dosbox/TCSETUP (Note: Replace $PATH with your actual directory path)
	     C:
	     cd TCSETUP
	     INSTALL.EXE

   Here, enter C:\TCSETUP as the source path.
   Enter C:\TC as the destination install path.
   Start installation.

   After installation is done, exit dosbox and copy the file Final.cpp into $PATH/dosbox/TC/BIN/

3) Run the game

   Execute dosbox:
     mount C: $PATH/dosbox/TC
     C:
     cd BIN
     TC.EXE

     File -> Open File -> Final.CPP
     Settings -> Linker -> Graphics Library (Select it if it is not selected)

     Run -> Run

     Enjoy!
